 # Caesar Cipher
 The Caesar Cipher is generally referred to as the most rudimentery form of cryptography. It is a substitution cipher, which means it works by substituting letters out with other letters.
 
 ## How does the Caesar Cipher work?
 Caesar Cipher works by rotating all of the characters over a certain amount of times, depending on the key.
 
 ## Demo
 You can try the Caesar Cipher for yourself by modifying the two variables below. Feel free to stick around and try a few different combinations.
 - ```message``` - The text you want to run through the cipher.
 - ```key``` - How many characters you want to rotate the message by.

let message = "Ashley Truluck"
